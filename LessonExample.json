            "question": "In the study of economics, we learned that one of the more effective ways of allocating scarce resources is to use PRICE.
                        PRICE =  A mechanism used to measure that the VALUE of a product or service.
                        The 2 forces that determine Price of goods & services are:
                        1. DEMAND – The amount of good & services that consumers (people) are willing to buy
                        2. SUPLY – The amount of goods/services that is offered in the market place, or that is available to be bought
                        How Demand & Supply affect Price:
                        -	When Supply is greater than Demand, Price will FALL.
                        -	When Demand is greater than Supply, Price will RISE.
